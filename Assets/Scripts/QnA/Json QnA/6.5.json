	{
		"QuestionType": "MCQ",
		"Question": "Why do both the student and the teacher see the student in front of a one-way mirror?",
		"Options": {
		"1": "Because the student is highly reflective",
		"2": "Because the teacher has enhanced vision",
		"3": "Because light that has reflected off the student enters both the student's and the teacher's eyes",
		"4": "Because the one-way mirror is transparent from both sides"
		},
		"CorrectAnswer": "Because light that has reflected off the student enters both the student's and the teacher's eyes",
		"Hint": "Consider the explanation for why both individuals see the student in front of a one-way mirror.",
		"Explanation": "The correct answer is (3) 'Because light that has reflected off the student enters both the student's and the teacher's eyes.' This explains why both can see the student."
	},
	{
		"QuestionType": "TrueFalse",
		"Question": "True or False: The student and the teacher see the student in front of a one-way mirror due to the high reflectivity of the mirror.",

		"2": "False"
		},
		"CorrectAnswer": "False",
		"Hint": "Reflect on the provided information about the reason for seeing the student.",
		"Explanation": "The correct answer is False. The statement is incorrect because the reason both individuals see the student is that the light reflected off the student enters both of their eyes, not solely because of the mirror's reflectivity."

		},
		"CorrectAnswer": "Bright light on one side, no light on the other side",
		"Hint": "Consider the description provided for the distribution of light when there is bright light on one side of a one-way mirror.",
		"Explanation": "The correct answer is (3) 'Bright light on one side, no light on the other side.' This describes the behavior of light in a one-way mirror when one side is brightly lit."
	},
	{
		"QuestionType": "FillInTheBlank",
		"Question": "When there is bright light on one side of a one-way mirror, the side with no light experiences _______.",
