    },
    "CorrectAnswer": "3",
    "hint": "Consider the effect of intense light on the reflective property.",
    "Explanation": "The brighter side of a one-way mirror appears reflective because more intense light causes a larger portion of the incident light to be reflected, making it difficult to see through from that side."

    },
    "CorrectAnswer": "3",
    "hint": "Think about how reduced light intensity affects light transmission.",
    "Explanation": "The see-through effect on the dimmer side of a one-way mirror occurs because lower lighting allows more light to transmit through, rather than being reflected."

    },
    "CorrectAnswer": "2",
    "hint": "Fill in with the relative lighting condition and the effect on light.",
    "Explanation": "Dimmer; transmit. The dimmer side of a one-way mirror allows more light to transmit through, resulting in a see-through effect."

    "QuestionType": "MCQ",
    "Question": "48. What factors can affect the behavior of a one-way mirror?",
    "Options": {
      "1": "Only the color of the light.",

      "3": "The type of glass used.",
      "4": "The thickness of the mirror."
    },
    "CorrectAnswer": "2",
    "hint": "Consider the various factors mentioned in previous questions.",
    "Explanation": "The behavior of a one-way mirror can be influenced by the intensity and distribution of light on each side, as well as the angle of observation. These factors play a crucial role in determining whether the mirror appears reflective or transparent."

      "3": "If the lighting conditions are similar on both sides or if there are strong light sources on both sides.",
      "4": "If the mirror is old."
    },
    "CorrectAnswer": "3",
    "hint": "Consider scenarios where the differential light effect is compromised.",
    "Explanation": "If the lighting conditions are similar on both sides or if there are strong light sources on both sides, the one-way effect may be less pronounced, leading to visibility from both sides."
